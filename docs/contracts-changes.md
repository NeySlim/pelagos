# Contract changes log

Append one entry per change to a shared file (`docs/architecture.md`,
`backend/pelagos/domain/`, `backend/pelagos/connectors/base.py`,
`backend/tests/conftest.py`, `backend/tests/fixtures/`, `backend/pelagos/cli.py`,
`backend/pyproject.toml`, `frontend/package.json`). Newest first. Changes are
additive and backward compatible during the parallel phase.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD, WP-NAME: one-line title
What changed (file, symbol). Why. Which packages must react, and how.
```

## 2026-10-24, WP-COLLECTOR: collector readers, ack entries, snapshots, signals
Additive, no schema change. `collector.alerts`: `AlertStore.list(...)` and
`AlertStore.summary()` back `GET /alerts` and `GET /alerts/summary`;
`ack_entry(node_id, alert, user, comment)` builds the `alert.ack` audit entry
(target `alert:<id>`) that `POST /alerts/{id}/ack` must append; the collector
replays every unconsumed ack entry (consumed ids kept in `meta` as
`ack:<entry id>`), so out-of-order replicated acks still apply. The collector
also appends `alert.raise` and `alert.resolve` entries (user `system`).
`collector.series.SeriesStore.engine_snapshot(node_id, engine)` returns
`{"node_id","engine","ts","kinds": {kind: {"ts","payload"}}}`: this is the
body of `GET /repl/v1/engines/<engine>/snapshot` (WP-CORE serves it,
`ReplicationClient.engine_snapshot` returns it). Snapshot kinds: bind
`capabilities,status,zone_list,zones,stats`; kea4/kea6
`capabilities,status,ha,utilization,subnets,config_hash`; d2
`capabilities,status,stats`; peers' liveness under engine `node`, kind `status`.
`collector.events.SignalListener` binds `/run/pelagos/collector.sock`;
WP-CORE registers its `config`/`audit` push handlers with `listener.on(...)`
instead of binding the socket itself; `send_signal(path, event)` is the
client side, and event `consistency` triggers a consistency pass (used by
`POST /alerts/consistency/run`). `collector.events.EventSink` sends section
18 messages to `events.sock`, which the web process (WP-API-AUTH) binds.
node.toml: `[engines] bind` may be a bool or the `[engines.bind]` table (TOML
forbids both at once); a table counts as enabled.

## 2026-10-24, foundation: initial contracts
`docs/architecture.md` sections 1 to 20, `pelagos.domain`, `connectors/base.py`,
fixtures. Baseline; nothing to react to.
